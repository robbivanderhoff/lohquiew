GW-BASIC — диалект языка программирования Бейсик, разработанный компанией Microsoft на основе диалекта BASICA и первоначально. Энциклопедия языков программирования. Добро пожаловать! Прогопедия — свободная. Mine was QBASIC on DOS. I learned from old magazines in elementary school that had the pages of source code you would type into your computer. I would often modify or even break games and software for the fun of it. I am 19 years old currently. Microsoft QuickBASIC (сокращённо QB, или неправильно «QBasic») — это  Используемый диалект Бейсика основан на диалекте GW-BASIC, однако. Hi, can javascript implement a function to read input from keyboard, like pascal readln, gwbasic input, C scanf/gets, C++ cin ? It should load an entire sequence of keys (as it was a string) into a variable WHEN RETURN IS HIT Just to complete what follows: function input(){ / ?????????????? / } alert("Enter something"); x=input(); alert("You entered:.

I DON'T KNOW WHATS GOING ON BUT I THINK I NEED TO REPROGRAM MY KEYBOARD. 
26 июн 2014  Я начинал с GW-BASIC под MS-DOS 2.0. arilou_camper 27 июня 2014 в 03:03. +3. Кто бы как Бейсик не ругал, но QLB — это прообраз. I'm refactoring an old piece of code from GWBASIC into Python. The code is FULL of GOTO's jumping all over the place which blows, I was wondering if anyone has any tips for refactoring it? Do I just use global variables for everything and write functions instead of goto statements? Or do I need to fix the flow of the program as a whole?or is there a better way of doing it? Let me know if there is somewhere else I should crosspost this! Snippet of code: 25 INPUT "EXISTING FILE (Y/N)";EF$. За выходом первой версии BASIC последовал выпуск других, улучшенных и обладающих большими возможностями, версий – GW–BASIC, QuickBASIC. Hачиная с версии MS-DOS 5.0, вместо устаревшего GW-BASIC фирма Microsoft стала поставлять систему QBASIC, которая предс- тавляет собой. Далее вместо названия Qbasic будем писать просто Бейсик. Существует несколько видов данного языка. Это GW-Basic, TurboBasic, Qbasic и так далее. Представленный автором комплекс показывает возможности языка QBASIC и позволяет разнообразить преподавание программирования в средней. На современных компьютерах используется следующие версии Basic: GWBasic, QBasic 4.5, Turbo Basic для DOS, Visual Basic 3.0-6.0 для Windows. Not sure how many of you are old enough to start learning programming before there was Linux. I started mine with GWBASIC. So I guess I owed it to Bill Gates. Recently I had the good fortune / misfortune to revamp an old Visual Basic 6 project, run in the discontinued Windows XP, hosted in Linux VMWARE. To my surprise, VB6 seems to be ahead of its time, as we attempt to port the old project to Angular. Not much has changed since VB GUI. In fact, it feels so slick, compared with the multi. 
J'ai sorti mon lecteur de disquettes 5,25 de son bac récemment pour copier les disquettes que j'ai depuis ma jeune jeunesse. Comme c'est probablement pas quelque chose qui se trouve maintenant facilement sur internet, surtout en français, je me suis dit que je pourrais les partager. Voici donc un zip contenant un menu BASIC (https://www.pedzlegeek.ca/oldstuff/SAP-BAS.zip) qui s'appelle "Sac à Puces 1" provenant de la Comission scolaire de Châteauguay. Mon jeu favori était bien-sûr la route. Come while it's fresh! I just hung up literally moments ago! About fifteen years ago, I was a bright-eyed coder still in college. My family was poor. Thankfully so was my country about people experienced in coding so I often did some freelance jobs to afford a living in my college city. One of the companies I coded for was one dedicated to importing metal, cutting it based on the customer's preferences and selling it. I doubt we need to know the details, but I had coded them a simple local. Hey guys So I've been away from SA for about 12 years now. I was a junior .NET developer at the time that I left. I'd been a junior dev for 2 years at that point. I've done no coding over here, save for starting to study Java few weeks ago. The thing is, I'm in China and it's getting really kak here, so my (Chinese) wife and I are going to be heading back to SA in the next year, maybe 2. I'd love to get back and get a coding job again, but I'm worried I need a fairly simple (at least I think its simple) program written and have no idea where to start. I did a little programming in high school (vb.net, gwbasic and some c++) but that was 10 years ago, but I would be willing to do the work my self if it wouldn't be that big of a time commitment. Essentially, I am tracking inventory from different groups. I need an easy to use program that keeps track of which (of 7 items) someone Hi, i've been lately cleaning and sorting all the MSDOS roguelikes i could found. It it's DOS i want it :). Well, even when i was playing roguelikes 20years ago (i remember getting Moria from old shareware catalogs), i've discovered games i've never played. "Dungeon" is a primitive (later versions are more complex obviously) basic/compiled roguelike from author Erik Oredson, all versions i got came with BAS source code (GWBasic?). These versions are: 1.0 - 1987 (only basic source code). I started working as a software developer at the company I work for in 2005 right out of college. I studied EE in college instead of CS because I was cocky and thought I knew everything I needed to know to be a good programmer already. I started toying with programming as a kid (GWBasic) and in High School my father found me an non-paying summer internship which taught me to program in Delphi (aka visual Pascal). So when I went to college I wanted to challenge myself and learn something 
I copied a couple of old codes to test on my Tandy 1000SL, the code works fine, but the simulation speed is way too fast and I can't comprehend what's going on on the screen. is there any way to slow down RUN speed for programs? It's operating on MS-DOS 3.3 and the programs are written in GWBASIC (ASCII). My mom has been suffering from Optic nerve atrophy since I was a kid. She's been legally blind for years now, along with being color blind. When my 4 siblings and I were little and she was deteriorating, but still on the edge of the legal limit, we'd play a fun game while driving called "WHAT COLOR IS THE LIGHT?" Somehow, we all lived :) Now, at 60, her world is a small, blurry bubble. I don't think she can focus much more than a couple inches in front of her face. When she got the Kindle - This guy has put together a ton of useful info about programming in DOS. The FAQ ( is definitely worth checking out as a first step - Downloads for many different BASIC IDEs (GWBASIC, QBASIC, VB 1-4, etc) https://archive.org/details/BorlandC55 - Borland C++ 5.5, Freeware release for DOS I'll update with any more info if I find anything relevant. Hello, At the moment, I am 33M currently working at a company that I greatly enjoy, as a Software Engineer. but I have no degree. While I have no intention of leaving my position anytime soon, I do worry it will affect future job prospects. Some background: Going back to summer, 2011, I was hired, through a staffing agency, as a Help Desk support technician in my current company. Prior to this, I have worked in Computer Repair / Support positions for many years. Going back further In high school I learned GWBASIC, C++, and vb.net and I remember vb.net having the ability to design a GUI for a program really easily; you were able to make buttons by just clicking add button or something to that effect. Ten years later, I have found the need to create a really basic program to help me out in my lab. I don't really have the want, need, or time to learn an entire language for this so I need some help. I need a way to make a program with an opening menu of a bunch of buttons. Verified?

I want to start off with the fact that this is my first time trying to program since gwbasic and qbasic more than 16 years ago. If there are any people out there looking to mentor beginners Id much appreciate the help. I am planning on picking up python and then possibly shifting to C. ok I started off reading a book on python 2.7 even though I was running 3.3.3 my mistake I know. below is the code which I believe should work as a simple number guessing game. I have tried to take input severa. Hello fellow Shibes! Not sure this is something that everyone will take some comfort form or even take the words as advice, but here is how I feel about the fluctuations of the Dogecoin pricing and value overall. A little background as you don't know me at all. I'm a computer person; been involved with them my whole life. Made my first computer program (RPG game) in 1992/1993 in GWBASIC and I've been hooked ever since to varying degrees. I understand computers very well - much better </p>
