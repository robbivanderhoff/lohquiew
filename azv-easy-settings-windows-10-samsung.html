Hey there! It has been a while since the last time I have lurked here, but I will soon be ready to make the jump from using laptops to building my own PC. That is, when I move into my own place in September/October. My work has involved alot of short term contracts over the past few years, but soon I should tackle on one which should last at least 2 years.
