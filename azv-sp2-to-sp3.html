Good Morning, After reading This ( article I know I have to upgrade CAS servers from Exchange 2010 SP2 to Exchange 2010 SP3 FIRST, then HUB, then Mailbox. once the cas servers are done, can the mailbox servers and the remainder of the servers stay on SP2 for a short time? Or does EVERYTHING have to be upgraded to SP3? Reason I ask, I am on a time crunch and need to get our OWA server up to SP3 so the dumb people. При разработке каждой версии SQL Server корпорация Microsoft использует внутреннее версионирование для контроля за выпускаемыми версиями продукта, например 7.00.699, где первое число соответствует. Hi all, I am those unlucky individuals that bought the SP2 a few months before the SP3 was announced and released. I was recently given the chance to upgrade to SP3 as a graduation gift. I do want to sell my SP2 but I bought it with microsoft complete warranty. Does anybody know if I can pay a small fee to transfer this warranty to SP3? If not possible, can I transfer this warranty to the buyer that ends up buying my SP2? If yes, how does it work because I think the warranty is tied to my micros.

So I did the move I didn't think I'd, at least not any time soon, but being my usual self I just couldn't stand not trying it. So all in all I bought a SP3 i5 8GB ram 256 ssd. Let me just say that I did read around here that the CPU downthrottles but I honestly didn't think it would be -this- bad. First thing I did, I installed WoW to try it out and see how it's acting. Well, on the SP2 it was playable at all times, but on the SP3 it just downthrottles at 900-1200mhz and just seems to be unpla.

Our setup currently is 2 CAS servers although only 1 is internet facing. 2 mailbox servers in a DAG with databases balanced evenly. About a week ago our group policy had a change that effected servers that were managed via WSUS. The end result our two mailbox servers decided to patch on their own from the internet instead of WSUS. What this did was bring our mailbox servers Endpoint Security 10 for Windows (рабочие станции)  Поддерживаемые виртуальные платформы. VMWare ESXi 6.0.0 3620759. When I open EMC or EWS, I get the following error gt mail.company.edu Connecting to remote server failed with the following error message : The WS-Management service does not support the request.

Hey guys, i have recently installed virtualbox to my mac so i can run some of my games in windows. Unfortunately the last pc i owned was quite old and ran on windows xp. I have the disk for it but it's SP2. Since microsoft have stopped supporting SP2 is it still possible for me to update it to SP3 and if so how? (Legally please:p) Also, if i'm running windows through VB do i still need to install drivers etc? Any help is useful! thanks:).

The Macbook Pro was updated to an iMac as a main computer, and the SP2 has been substituted by a Surface Pro 3. Just now I sold the SP2 and delivered it, and I'm already missing some things about it. Good stuff: The design is now better, thinner, and with a much better kickstand. The keyboard is way better, coming from a TC1. And the screen looks brighter. This is important in my country because there.

I just installed upgraded SP2 to SP3 in anticipation of migrating this weekend to 2013. After installing SP3, IIS isnt fucntioning properly and any navigation to https://mail.domain.com/owa just comes up connection refused. Are there any changes that may have happened with the SP3 install? Any help greatly appreciated. Последняя версия, доступная для Windows XP SP3. Для более новых операционных систем устанавливать не нужно. Just wondering if there is any information regarding the compatibility of using an SP3 pen or keyboard with an SP2. I realise the keypad will overhang the screen edge when closed, but the improved touchpad may be worth the annoyance. I'm getting SP3 from a colleague to make a decision, whether I should go for it or wait to the SP4. It's the same model I have (i5 256). I'm too busy right now to go through the whole process of installing my stuff (office, autocad, other engineering stuff). Can I just somehow make an image of the system and just move everything to the SP3? I'm also in Windows 10 on my SP2. Sorry if dumb question. I have an Exchange Server 2010 on SP3 Update Rollup 24 Version 14.03.0419, single server w/all roles, no DAGs. Just two nights ago all of the Exchange services have begun restarting approx. 4:30 AM server time. But, the Information Store service remains in a Stop Pending state and thus server cannot restart it. It eventually stops and remains stopped till I manually start it. Application log has event indicating it could not start the IS service because another instance is already running.

Hello fellow Exchange admins. Today I've found out our Exchange 2010 Edge server that routes our mails to and from 365 is barebone SP3. Because of 365 cutting TLS 1.0 I will have to get it up to date with our internal Exchange servers which are on CU 18 and ready to TLS 1.1 and 1.2. I've seen warning stating that after updating Edge from SP2 to SP3 You have to re-subscribe it, but what about situation going to CU 18 directly? I've already have guides how to re-do the hybrid config I am deciding whether to purchase the SP4 now or wait for the next update. By no means do I want to wait endlessly just for an update, but I know that the SP4 is now in its mid-product cycle, and I don't want to buy one now only to have the 5 come out, say, two months from now (June release like the SP3). My worry is that this will turn out like the SP2 to SP3 update. I wouldn't have been too thrilled if I purchased an SP2 6 months after launch only to have the SP3 released so soon afterwards. Why do sp2 to sp3 transitions during an organic reaction occur more quickly close to C-D bonds than C-H bonds (and vice versa)? Sorry if this seems like a really specific question, but neither the internet nor textbooks seem to have the solution. So I just updated all my Exchange servers from Exchange 2010 SP2 to SP3 RU14. Now when ever I perform cross site dag failovers (moving the cluster IP off-site and mounting the DBs to the same site), outlook is now telling users they have to close and re-open. It didn't do this before. It's even doing this in sites that have a local casarray. Is this a patch that outlook needs? The CAS and MB roles are separate in each site. There is a load balancer for the CAS servers at each site both window. 
I'd love a little feedback from people who've had both. I've had a Surface 3 a few days, it's clear my Creative Cloud apps would benefit from a faster CPU. Is there a massive performance or functional difference from SP2 to SP3/4? If the newer Pro models were 10" I'd get that for sure but I'm concerned 12" will be too big. It's really a machine to grab and go for me, not my desktop replacement. I'm updating our exchange servers from SP2 to SP3 that is made up of 3 AD sites. 1 Active and 2 DR/Passive sites. I'm a bit unclear on who gets the update first. All the DBs are hosted in one site. Do I upgrade the passive sites first or do I upgrade the primary site first? I want to do the remote sites first to make sure nothing crazy happens, then fail over the primary, and then do the primary then fail back. Edit: To be clearer. The server has to be passive no doubt. I know this question probably gets asked a lot, so apologies in advance. I've done a lot of research and I just want a few things cleared up. For both, I'm planning to get the i5 256GB version. I'm mainly going to be using it for some word processing for school, some very light gaming (Minecraft, visual novels, nothing crazy), video streaming/viewing, general internet browsing, and some doodling (I'm not a serious artist). 1) How valuable is having the multiple viewing angles Since we have upgraded our Exchange 2010 environment from SP2 to SP3 RU5 we have noticed a few oddities in our PowerShell scripts that uses the Exchange cmdlets. Originally we would just load the PPSnapin for Exchange, but that stopped working for some cmdlets in SP3. Now we create a PSSession to a random CAS in our main site. The code we use is below If ((Get-Command Get-Mailbox -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Verbose:$false) -ne $Null) {Write-Verbose "Exchange PSSnapin is loaded, Proceedi. Exec's mobile devices (Galaxy S5, tablet, iPod) refuse to sync calendar changes in either direction. This includes PC to mobile and mobile to PC. Nobody else in the organization is having these issues. The devices have all of the latest OS updates installed. Also went from Exchange 2010 SP2 to SP3 RU7 last night in an effort to fix it but it actually made things worse. Now exec's email and contacts are not working. I've pulled ActiveSync logs from when this first started Say I purchase the (i5 128Gb) SP3 from my favorite warehouse store and then purchase MS complete. Do the benefits of MS complete follow the machine or the purchaser in the following circumstances? 1) What happens if I decide that I want to return the i5 and purchase a different SP3 model (i7/256Gb, etc)? Am I able to transfer the benefits of MS Complete to the new SP3 or did I just loose that investment (0)? 2) What happens if the SP4 is released (soon) and I want to return 
So I've recently gotten my old XP desktop from 2004 to work again by putting in a couple of spare parts and reformating. The problem now is that I can't get it to connect to the network I've got it on, I get an error-message saying "Limited or No Connectivity". It's connected via network-cable to a router that I've got several other computers connected to and they all can connect flawlessly. If I do an IPconfig on the XP it tells me that it has autoconfigured to connect to an IP-adress starting. </p>
